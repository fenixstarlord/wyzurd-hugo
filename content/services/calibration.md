The swings from a freezing night shoot to a sweltering summer day can cause field production displays to drift over time, causing a global tint towrds blue, or putting a natural lift into the shadows. With a professional display, these imperfections can be tuned back towards a near factory state.

### Display Balance
#### $200, 1-2hr per display
Using a spectrophotometer and a colirometer I will analyze your display and balance your RGB values at full bright and at 20% - 30% grey.  This will correct most color shifts. I will also change your display lumninance and contrast to get as close to your color space as possible (usually REC709).

Usually to attain a fully correct contrast response a characterization may be required.

### Display Charecterization
#### $500, 4-6hr per display
With a display characterization I will run a series of color patches and measure the degrees of error.  Using a large dataset I can create a 3D LUT that will correct for contrast and color errors. This information can be uploaded directly to the monitor (Flanders, SmallHD) or loaded through a LUT Box (Sony).

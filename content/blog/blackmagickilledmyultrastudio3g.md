title: 'Blackmagic Killed my Ultrastudio'
---
Well, it finally happened. Blackmagic has killed my Ultrastudio 3G with Thunderbolt 2.  They had Apple's help with their new driver managment.  

If you didn't know, the decklink drivers on MacOS Sequoia is new a "Camera Driver", and for whatever reason that seems to be causing a lot of issues for people with older ultrastudio hardware.

This happened right when I was starting a monitor calibration for Rushlight Studios, which made a simple job a bit of a pain. Fortunately I had purchased an AJA io4k over the summer since I was so impressed with AJA's performance in Assimilate Scratch, and another bout of good fortune, Assimilate Scratch is compatible with my monitor calibration software (Colourspace) as a signal generator! So no hard feeling Blackmagic.

It was inevitable, I haven't had much gear that has lasted as long as that little ultrastudio. I will probably be getting a newer ultrastudio mini 4k with TB3 for small in field DIT builds, but for now AJA has my back.

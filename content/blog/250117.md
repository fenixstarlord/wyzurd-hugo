title: 'New Website, Who Dis?'
---
Check out the new site! It's simple, it's clean, its...free?  That's right! I'm using the CMS [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to create a dead simple site that's managed with markdown files on github.

Why am I doing this? Well to save money obviously. And I really just wanted a website that was deconstructed, and looked a bit more like a notion document.  Hopefully I'm lowering the upkeep and making it easier to update in the process.

If you're looking at this site now, expect it to change quite a bit. I'm currently grappling with how to market myself, as a person that's has a foot both on set and in post, and enjoys doing both. I think the biggest challenge is how to accurately convey that I can download your footage, support your editor, create aspect edits, and do the final color grade (or support your in house colorist).

First up, I need to create a new reel (sigh). I've always envied those that love cutting their reels, it's definitely not my favorite activity. Possibly becasue I'm behind a compute rso much for work, that when I'm not working I'd rather be doing something with my hands.

## Things to do
* create a reeel
* update resume
* port over some old posts like the magic rsync recipe
* write some more stuff!

I figured it was time to refresh my social media presence in the gig space (LinkedIn) and I realized I'm usually the guy behind the camera.  Not only that, but now that I have two kids, I just don't have the time to set up a photo shoot for myself.  So I did what any responsible American did in the year 2025, I turned to ai.

I did a little bit of research of the many many many ai headshots websites that are out there, and really couldn't sift out what was good what was bad.  Ultimately I ended up just following a reddit post asking for reccomendations and saw the owner of proshoot.co piped in.  I figured, if this guy is passionate enough to post in the reddits, I'll give it a chance.

I uploaded 15 images of myself to the website to create a decent LORA of myself, and here's what it popped out!

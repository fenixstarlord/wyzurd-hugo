I'm almost finished with modding my iPad mini with Cam Creux's excellent [netbridge mod](https://www.camcreux.com/product-page/spudnik-ipad-mod#). I started this in October but was pulled away by fatherhood and the chaos that comes with it.

This time I reprinted the case in PETG (previously in ASA) and I've soldered together the gold mount plate so that the ipad can run forrrrevvverrrrr.  I'm using a [super tiny gold mount battery](https://cinemilled.com/p/core-swx-nano-micro-50-lithium-ion-battery-gold-mount/?srsltid=AfmBOoqI_pvSaxJvSr53Xl_WosdZiaf3-LqE66j1BJMNsb0mZS9SEjkR) by Core SWX.

For those of you that don't know, netbridge is a point to point 802.11ah chipset that allows a 1 to 4 communication.  It runs on the 900mhz frequency, meaning it goes a real long way (by [Sam Petrov's testing](https://www.makeyourown.lol/learn/projects/teehee-halow/halow-range/), the netbridge goes 580ft in the open).  Also due to it's lower frequency, the 900mhz can easily punch through concrete and other walls.

I'm hoping to use the netbridge in combination with the ipad, so that the ipad is the reciever and the 3 transmitters I will be using will be Cam A, Cam B, and my cart respictively.

That way the ipad can not only act as camera control but also as a spoke to the wheel of devices that are around it, eliminating any range issues when dealing with sprawling or tight sets.  If I feel like my cart isn't reaching the camera, I can just clamp the ipad on the DoP's monitor for camera control and hop it backwards to my cart.

Some day I'll switch completely over to Sam's Teehee Halow, which is a similar design but can mesh. Giving it, theoretically, a massive network range.

As soon as I figure out how to easily post photos with hugo, I'll add some to my blog posts. But for now, just check out my instagram and take a look!
